				<div class="subtitle" style="font-size: 45px;">Rage of Love</div>
				<p>A sharp hint of sunlight woke her up.The chirping birds brought comfort and a sense of company .From the same window&nbsp; Kaira admired the chinar leaves that made a rusty carpet path and&nbsp; loved the crackling sound every time anyone&nbsp; put their steps on it. She had a promsing day ahead .She was going for lunch after college with her cheerful friend Rosy and discuss their future plans regarding masters marriage and much more .Together&nbsp; they could spin theverbal wheels for the erst of the day .</p>
				<p>She&nbsp;&nbsp; got up to make herself&nbsp; a nice hot cup of tea and some warm lavasa without disturbing her mother . A lavish spread of butter and pure&nbsp; bliss broke into&nbsp; her mouth . .She stretched out and soon found a golden patch of sun glowing on her flowery quilt and the sunflowers looked even brighter .Kaira felt grateful for small little things and acknowledged the value of&nbsp; good health ,great energy ,a cheery posture ,healthy appetite and great friends .</p>
				<p>. Dressed for the college, she walked out having carried a bright yellow change for lunch . The heavenly drops rejuvenated her and she danced in the rusty brown paradise with an endearing&nbsp; carelessness .Something came over her and she waltzed in a frenzy ,the way she saw in some of the bollywood flicks , swooping herself down one time and then swiftly circling the entire area, one hand in the air and the other holding an imaginary hand. Some people sitting on the bench looked aghast and even ashamed .She looked happy and involved in the inner working of her mind, and for her it was not an&nbsp; awkward overbearing moment but sheer happiness at feeling something as&nbsp; pure and divine like&nbsp; fresh air and a clear light of the morning ...This is what it must be to feel happy ,she thought to herself</p>
				<p>She stopped , as a&nbsp; crowd had gathered , she&nbsp; picked up her bag , smiled at them and walked ahead , dancing to her favourite tune, unmindful of the amused laughter by the crowds ..</p>
				<p>This dance on the crsip and crackling chinar leaves her alive and she would cherish this memory&nbsp; for years to come.</p>
				<p>College was mundane and soon after it finished ,she ran into&nbsp; the oppenness of the streets but crossing the road on an afternoon in Srinagar , especially after college was not easy anymore . There were&nbsp; vehicles that seemed to have multiplied, the college students , dressed up in white salwar kamiz&nbsp; were spread in all directions , carts laden with apples and pears interrupted the traffic flow , There was a multicultural diversity in the way people moved and spoke , some heading for the temple with the puja provisons and some crossing the road to go to the mosque.A beggar stopped kaira for alms and as she stopped to take out the change she bumped into a stranger who swore under his breath but something about him sent a&nbsp; chill down her spine . Not caring she stepped down into the shikara and crossed over to the other side , climbed a few steps to enter&nbsp; Blue Diamond , the restaurant .</p>
				<p>The waiter signalled at the corner table where Rosy was already waiting for her .The girls hugged one another and soon hot steaming kahwa flowed out of the samovar and the kebab platter with bread reached in no time. Coversation flowed easy , so much to talk about giggles laughter and gossip all got downed with the hot steaming kahwa .</p>
				<p>A&nbsp; commotion followed by a succession of gun shots. The waiters ducked under the table and suggested that we all did the same.Some vehicles frantically ran by on the road and soon the entire atmosphere got clouded by some white smoky thing. &lsquo;Tear gas whispered Rosy from behind the chair!&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Whatever happened?</p>
				<p>&lsquo;I think the azadi gang is out yet again.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Azadi gang? What is that?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;This is people who want to separate from the country and live their own lives.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>They were interrupted by a male voice firm and decisive &lsquo;hey girls where do you stay?</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Nawakadal, um&nbsp; closeby, why? blurted Kaira</p>
				<p>I am giving you an escort and please go back home, Lal Chowk has had some trouble and it may worsen, so please go back before your family is worried for you.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;But what is ----??</p>
				<p>Behind them they could hear whispers that some defence&nbsp; personnel had been gunned down near Airforce headquarters&nbsp; and that the city would be under curfew.</p>
				<p>Abdul the restaurant owner asked hi s assistant kabir to go with the girls and to reach them home safely. Kaira was unhappy to have a&nbsp; situation like this in her peaceful haven What impression will her friends in Delhi and Mumbai&nbsp; get of her home place? Always did she tell him how beautiful and full of peace her home was? They saw a young girl along with her mother being dragged along the road with a group of jeering lads throwing stones. Loud shrieks and imploring shouts shook the scene. &ldquo;Good for them, she ran a brothel &lsquo;commented Abdul.They were huddled in a vehicle and deposited in their respective homes but it was intercepted en route by gunfire.. Loud shouts and slogans of azadi azadi filled up the air . A little child huddled in her mothers bosom&nbsp; shrieked at the uncanny turbulence . It didn&rsquo;t matter wether he understood the chaos but noise and a frenzied atmosphere was enough to make it restless.She saw fear on its face and soon the baby tuckes its face in the mothwr's lap. Rosy&nbsp; bought her headscarf closer to her eyes as though to hide her identity. Taking cue from her she did the same .</p>
				<p>Following morning curfew was imposed for the first time in the valley . Loud threats from the mosques filled up the atmosphere . it was scary when they said that non muslims have to leave the place or join the movement .There was also news that the Government of India had plans to release student protesters, reopen schools and universities and setup a high-level committee to open dialogue with political parties, civil society groups, students and other representatives.</p>
				<p>Waking up she saw her family discussing some matters in great seriousness .</p>
				<p>&ldquo;we have a house in delhi and we could shift &ldquo;</p>
				<p>We could also stay in jammu for some time and then go further on till the kids finsish their high school said her uncle .&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There the government ahs promised some camp and they are going to look after us . &ldquo;</p>
				<p>Not so sure about what the government says said the uncle in apprehension&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Within a week Kaira moved out of the valley as there were loud threats . She hardly had toime to inform her friend Rosy .Something snapped within her .She Soon she drifted off to the land of dreams fired with the lust for life beyond the valley .</p>
				<p>The night to spend was not kind either and Kiara woke up to noises in the middle of the night. It was a cold night and she heard announcements from the nearby mosques asking people to get out of the valley. She pinned her ears close to the window and heard it much better. It was an open threat . She threw her blanket for she felt the sweat trickling down between her bosoms. Fully awake she heard the sound of many feet clambering on the road outside. Some stones got hurled and she felt the harshness of the big stone on the tin roof. It could have possibly dented the roof, she thought. The urgency in the steps was not good news. She remembered Rosy and Nafeesa and Lily who stayed in the neighbourhood .The&nbsp; marching sound of soldiers with stretchers and the hoot of ambulances was deafening.</p>
				<p>B</p>
				<p>The HR personnel was beaten up to death and the news channels kept flashing that repeatedly . Indignity cruelty and lawlessness&hellip;&hellip;.There was a group of workers who crossed over the barricade , beat up the trapped personnel and then put the place on fire in india . Next to this was another news item about a pretty airhostess who committed suicide for she was exploited and rendered hopeless by a rich guy .</p>
				<p>Militancy of the mind more dangerous and more penetrative !</p>
				<p>Equally disastrous and debilitating and there is no government help on this front .We are all our own governments and we have to govern ourselves</p>
				<p>A&nbsp; bleeding rickshaw puller,with a motherless child strapped up across his chest while he was pulling the rickshaw got her attention . the baby&nbsp; shrieked for it was hungry , any takers the papers asked , the wailing father , the hungry child , her mind getting filled in with smoke , could it be the tear gas ?</p>
				<p>Varun was hacked and then burnt to death by a restless mob that worked under him .Dissatisfied&nbsp; with their plight they killed him&nbsp; . She was left alone , tears had dried up for it was no use , varun was not coming back , he died helpless and defeated . she had to save her energy for living, for to live is a cocktail of bravery, courage and strentgth and she needed that .</p>
				<p>Give me your books I beckon you to come here !!</p>
				<p>Little babloo couldn&rsquo;t care less and carried on pulling the pages from her favourite book .</p>
				<p>I will slap you and then you know</p>
				<p>On hearing that he threw the entire book fro the window</p>
				<p>Maya threw the rubber at him and it hit his left eye and there was chaos</p>
				<p>What happened ? the two of you will never let me be in peace !</p>
				<p>Today is my birthday ma and see he tore my birthday present</p>
				<p>How old are you ?</p>
				<p>I am fifteen</p>
				<p>So shame on you your brother is only seven</p>
				<p>So he isn&rsquo;t justified to do such things and she stormed out of her room</p>
				<p>Kaira&nbsp; eyed her uncle from the corner of her eyes and in the manner of solving a most difficult code ,wondered what maddened him on her twenty third birthday. He rushed in accusingly,at her mother &rdquo;she is so grown up and you still celebrate her birthday.?&rdquo; Mother looked highly apologetic for having perfoermed an illegitimate ceremony, not meant for women and girls .She&nbsp; should have known that such ceremonies befit only the men and boys and get marked in the calendar from the begining of the year. Age is not a bar for men of all age groups where birthdays mean women slogging to arrange for a thunderous and a roaring celebration .</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>She loved Varun and could not bear to think of life without him. He was the soul of her body the spirit behind her being and she could not carry on being without him.</p>
				<p>He was gone . I will be next door he had sad.</p>
				<p>One day one of us will be alone , isn&rsquo;t that so ?</p>
				<p>Yes why do you ask ?</p>
				<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you but tell me how to manage our lives&nbsp; then ?</p>
				<p>It is so simple , just think we are next door ! and the bonding will be even more romantic sublime and fuss free, his laughter roared in Kairas ears .</p>
				<p>It was so typical of&nbsp; to belittle the intensity of an emotion. In this case it&nbsp; was done to underplay the devastating undercurrents of mortality .</p>
				<p>For sometime she stopped talking to people for what difference did it make . did they understand what she was talking did they go deep into where she went plucking out feelings of pain or&nbsp; pleasure so why even tell for they will never understand what you are trying to convey nor even try to do so. It was like aunt Aruna&nbsp; who had to talk about even the intimate moments from the forbidden realms, in order to evoke awe and exercise control over her peers but this wasn&rsquo;t my&nbsp; aim and I have&nbsp; no target audience . For me to&nbsp; talk means to ease myself off from pressing emotions and feelings and&nbsp; to digest some parts&nbsp; with the satisfaction of a whiskered lion who devours meat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
				<p>C</p>
				<p>On Lilys invitation she went back to her home state of Srinagar Kashmir.</p>
				<p>Militancy had an impact on the place. clean and crisp air felt heavier than before, terrorism that Kaira's too was familiar with, not limited to territories and political boundaries and is without a meaning..</p>
				<p>The evening air was getting colder and she wrapped herself more cosily with her shawl . .She had to cross over in a shikara to meet Rosy afetr twenty two years . She was also eager to see her angel eyed eight year old son Farhad .While walking she crossed some familiar homes of her friends and relatives .It bought upon her a strange peace and once&nbsp; she stopped to touch the grass in the park. it felt nice as it felt familiar , it smelt of the past . Each memory has a fragrance that just swishes past when we remember an event or a person .</p>
				<p>It had a similar fragrance , a memory an aroma that kept on lingering in the air .</p>
				<p>The fallen&nbsp; autumn leaves had&nbsp; a vast emptiness, a vast hollow of despair and nothingness Before it could envelop her she moved along to catch the shikara. The valley rains were beautiful; in their sudden sharpness and then a quiet fade out.&nbsp; The rains spoilt the crunch and the&nbsp; golden leaves had softened.</p>
				<p>Meeting Rosy&nbsp; wasn&rsquo;t easy .Both were victims of violence and losses .Even though both of diverted the topic of of our respective lives spent in the last twenty eyars, there was silence punctuated with awkwardness. Many questions had to be answered&nbsp; and none was prepared to take the load of this exercise .</p>
				<p>She was talking about the ravages of militancy and how her&nbsp; three uncles one of them with two wives, many cousins grandparents suffered in the aftermath and how people were trying to find a sense of meaning in their lives after losing their near and dear ones. At this she&nbsp; stopped , as though making an apology ..Kaira asked her not to worry and that she had moved on after losing Varun to mob violence . Violence had no state and it crossed all&nbsp; borders .</p>
				<p>Varun is still very close to me . he lives next door &ldquo;He taught me to depend on him for answers and he is there</p>
				<p>Kaira felt an emotional meltdown after a dreadful stillness of time .She let off her guard for some time put her head on Rosys shoulders and in that quick trun of time , in that fleeting momnet she suddenly felt the tender touch of&nbsp; her fathers hand when he healed her leg ,A boiling pan of water had turned down and fallen on her young knee ,exposing her bones and the pink of the burnt skin .. It must have been very difficult to cradle a five year old baby so badly burnt and scalded .He saved my limb&nbsp; . We&nbsp; remember our parents when they are inefficient and powerless , when they have no role to play in our lives when they stop intimidating ."Parents should not expect for that brings pain. parenting is like any other job ,finsih your work with sincerity and come back home ' is what Varun used to say . When in a harsh and a sombre mood he would say ," God ensures that he gives you children for then you have reasons to quit the world happily ." .</p>
				<p>&rsquo;After that he became&nbsp; varun&nbsp; the chatur [ wise one&nbsp; ]for me .&rdquo; is this an accolade or an unjust comment?&rdquo;, he asked and young babloo let out a joyful chuckle while playing with his mothers ring ,which made everyone break out in an applause.&rdquo;Now you know what I meant !&rdquo;</p>
				<p>D</p>
				<p>She saw him ..It was a magical moment but she couldn&rsquo;t understand why&nbsp; he had layers around him, layers of himself woven around him in a strange manner. He looked warped and misshaped but something about him made a stirring motion inside her and she felt a lump inside her throat .she couldn&rsquo;t cry but he reminded her of the historical mummies that lay wrapped up in a hideous pale and grey material layers and layers go around them as though bandaging a wounded soul .&nbsp; It was Varun&nbsp; . Even though she had tried to forget him , the&nbsp; reserves melted and the emotions flooded but she couldn&rsquo;t move.she slipped into a sate of induced slumber</p>
				<p>&nbsp;She saw the shadow yet again , this time of her son who stooped down to see if she was alright after the she wanted to get up hold him tight but she had&nbsp; frozen in time and also in&nbsp; body .she felt a flurry of men in white roaming around and fussing over her but wandered in the dingy corridors of her mind &nbsp;and blackness enveloped her soon .Before that she waved a good bye to her son who she left at a boarding school at the age of eight&nbsp; bye my baby I cant leave you there my darling&nbsp; &ndash;come running and I will hold you in my arms, don&rsquo;t worry you will not fall, you will not stay alone .</p>
				<p>&nbsp;unhinged ,loose and free she slipped into a big circle of nothingness soothing in its closure.</p>
				<p>She woke up with a start to see blooming flowers sunshine that fell straight on her face .She was living and breathing .&nbsp; In all this she&nbsp; recognized the warm, special moments that make up and finally become&nbsp; memories !This accumulation of thoughts and feelings can make us happy but also drive us crazy for you remember them&nbsp; not once but many times over ones lives .</p>
				<p>Kaira&rsquo;s&nbsp; relationship with herself&nbsp; was rather tricky and difficult . For some time it was resplendent with the colours of this world, love, matrimony ,domesticity ,but later it switched over to fear .. She feared living , she&nbsp; feared the fast paced nature of time well known for not waiting for anyone . This fickle minded and fast moving controller got her&nbsp; nervous . She&nbsp; wanted to catch it but&nbsp; found&nbsp; it slipping fast between her&nbsp; fingers .The more she&nbsp; held it , the more she&nbsp; could see it&nbsp; running away from her. She wanted to swallow its transience but it proved even more ruthless for it hurt her</p>
				<p>She&nbsp; flicked her eyes and it was gone leaving her with regrets and even more doubts about her worth .Time waits for none , said her history teacher , the kings and the emperors had to bow before it ,.</p>
				<p>&ldquo; You know I can&nbsp; bring back the time&rdquo;</p>
				<p>How asked Varun mockingly</p>
				<p>&ldquo; well , by living in the past moment, &ldquo; and she laughed at her witty repertoire and in a way echoing Prashants philosophy of living the moment to the full.</p>
				<p>The soft yellow chinar leaves made a noise once again.There are no ordinary moments, no minutes or seconds that are meaningless. And most of all, we will never get back those moments that pass without recognition .&rdquo;I have been going back in time and have seen a pattern emerge , curiously and amazingly I have foun d that time is a designer of sorts . Even though it swishes away , it makes a pattern of events, happenings ,incidents ,coincidences and the day we understand this pattern,we respect it for its well known restless energy.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She joined the handsome shadow , felt the cold grip .She flew away in grace and dignity and what a wonderful lightness it was! Looking down one glance swept across her days of&nbsp; earthy yesteryears and she sped her flight to heavens up above. The thoughts became like feather light and then lighter nd then faded slowly and forever , for the spirit soared higher and higher gliding over the beautiful pines ,crossing the lovely chinar trees the snowy peaks and the glaciers that she loved . It felt free to wander without any boundaries ecstatic light and free!!</p>
