				<div class="subtitle" style="font-size: 45px;">Rage of Love</div>
				<p>It was a magical moment ,watching the souls go by . One had layers around ; layers that wrapped it in a strange manner as though holding a child . Something about this soul stirred her &nbsp;and she felt a lump inside her throat .&nbsp; The reserves melte, emotions flooded, her vision blurred but she couldn&rsquo;t move, even though she wanted to get up and hold him close . She was alive but could not move .&nbsp; Not only was she still in body but also in mind. She felt a flurry of men in white roaming around and fussing over her. She wandered in the dark corridors of her mind till blackness enveloped her .Weakly she waved a good bye to her eight year old son in a residential school, far away from home .</p>
				<p>She could hear him sing <em>hundred miles away from home ..</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;&nbsp;bye my baby !.&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;come running back home , come to me and I will hold you in my arms. &lsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;don&rsquo;t worry you will not , you will never feel alone .i shall be with you always .&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p>A drop trickled down the corner of her eye &nbsp;when she saw him waving his hand at her as she finally left him alone .. Unhinged ,loose and free she slipped into a big circle of nothingness soothing in its closure.</p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Operation successful&rsquo; declared the doctor as he came out, shaking hands with Rishaan .&lsquo;She may have difficulties in remembering some events .Dont force her to think and remember events, &nbsp;for some time at least .</em></p>
				<p>&nbsp;She woke up with a start to see blooming flowers sunshine that fell straight on her face .She was alive, an unbeatable feeling! Kaira had a bad fall from her balcony on the fourth floor when she stepped out on the ledge to water a flower bed. Some broken ribs and a clot in her brain complicated the case leading to a fractured memory .Her life was going to be different .A life that once was&nbsp; resplendent with the colours of this world, love, matrimony ,domesticity &nbsp;would now be trying to figure out people and places . She appeared confused and made an earnest effort to remember and connect conversations and people ; wanted to catch her past&nbsp; but&nbsp; found&nbsp; it slipping fast between her&nbsp; fingers .The more she&nbsp; held it , the more she&nbsp; could see it&nbsp; running away from her. &nbsp;</p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Time&nbsp; changes the kings and the emperors had to bow before it .&rsquo;who said this ?</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Deedi&nbsp; have the soup , you need to be nourished &lsquo;&nbsp; . </em></p>
				<p><em>She opened her eyes and looked blankly at a pretty young girl .</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Mama can I have more apple sauce please?&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p>The voices were drowning and there was an echo that lingered on. There was pain but she could not pin point and say where it was coming from ..It hurt her even more as days went by and the&nbsp; memories started flooding her mind but gradually her mindscape was getting better, &nbsp;like a clearing in the sky after a heavy smog. Her anxiety had a mix of anger and fear ..</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Mrs Patkar I am Shinde from the police department ,do you remember&nbsp; how you fell down? &ldquo;</p>
				<p>She closed her eyes .</p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;I just slipped</em> I think .&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Was there anyone else around?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Please let her be ,said the doctor .Dont force her to remember , may be a little later . &hellip; &ldquo;</p>
				<p>Family albums is what the doctor had suggested. &nbsp;She religiously &nbsp;rummaged through old pictures and videos for over some months &nbsp;and that was working somehow.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;Little did she realize that remembering things might not be a boon but a bane ..</p>
				<p>&nbsp;Diya her younger sister had moved in after their parents died in a tragic car accident travelling from Ooty to Delhi .It was a blow to the sisters but with one another they sailed through difficult times . Diya was pursuing her masters in literature. Her laughter&nbsp; was a kind of a reassurance that Kiara was doing a good job ,mothering her after the untimely void especially after Nikhil her son went out to study . On a school picnic he got washed off&nbsp; with the dam water . The world closed in on &nbsp;kiara and the relationship with her husband became a thing of the past .Kiara was perceptive enough to understand the changing dynamics; Rishaans fondness for her younger sister Diya was highly noticeable . It was pain mingled with anguish, trust with betrayal and promises with shattered words and all this made a noise in her being.</p>
				<p>The memory blocks were rearranged finally but the picture was painful.</p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Rishaan what is the need to book three tickets for the film . Diya said she isn&rsquo;t interested .&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;I can see that you can&rsquo;t do without her &lsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Oh just shut up I will do what I think is right&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>You call it right ? shameful!&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>Before she could utter another word his hand flashed across her face and she stood speechless dazed and angry .</em></p>
				<p><em>Nikhil where are you ?</em></p>
				<p>&lsquo; Mrs. Patkar? &lsquo;</p>
				<p>This time it was the doctor who walked in with Rishaan .She looked startled.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Rishaan any progress?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;She feels tired and cannot sleep well,&rsquo; he &nbsp;said nervously .</p>
				<p>The doctor prescribed some medicines along with sleeping tablets..</p>
				<p>&ldquo;A brief vacation &hellip; I was thinking if we could go to Goa &hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Yes of course !&rsquo;, exclaimed the doctor.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;kiara do you remember last holiday ?&rsquo;Rishaan asked her in a very measured manner.</p>
				<p><em>Is he testing my memory ?</em></p>
				<p>&lsquo;No&rsquo;, replied Kiara and shook her head.</p>
				<p><em>Of course I do remember , you slipped out of fright when you saw a snake on the beach </em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Your sister is so pretty and so talented kaira sure she is your sister and you are not adopted &lsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Lets have a little party in our beautiful balcony will have some friends over too&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>Great ,What do I cook for dinner?&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Yes let us freshen up these &nbsp;flowers Kiara &lsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Ok will help you ..&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Come along, lets water it first&rsquo; </em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Why you feeling so hot your are sweating in this cold evening&rsquo; </em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Just go fast and I will help you &lsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>She crossed &nbsp;over to the ledge and felt his hand behind her back and then a swift push.</em></p>
				<p><em>Rishaaaaaan .. </em></p>
				<p><em>As she flew down she saw Rishaan with his back towards her .He did not look distraught and helpless. She fell down with a thud .He did not look back.</em></p>
				<p>She lifted her eyes from one of the family pictures . Everything appeared hazy.</p>
				<p>Kaira was careful not to tell anyone that she remembered the catastrophic truth about Rishaan .That would endanger her life further ..</p>
				<p>She got up to make a call .</p>
				<p>Goa meant added fear and stress , for she was not only fearing for her life but was &nbsp;trying to keep Rishaan away from Diya and was noticing every move of his .</p>
				<p>&nbsp;Rishaan made elaborate plans for a seven day&nbsp; trip to Goa .Kiara was unwilling but gave in as Diya made numerous pleas. Something she felt was not right with her .An instinct perhaps.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;In the middle of the flight, Kiara woke up to go the washroom. When she returned, she was too lazy to push her way into the middle seat. And with Rishaan readily offering to shift seats, the seating arrangement changed. With 20 minutes still remaining for the flight to land, a sleep starved Kiara took another power nap, this time holding Rishaan's right hand more firmly. Rishaan's other hand, though, nervously moved to touch Diya's. Her heart skipped a beat. Diya pulled her hand away. But a defiant Rishaan held her wrist again, this time firmly and more reassuringly. The changing behavioral dynamics between the three perhaps gave out a foreboding of what was to come in Goa.<br /> <br /> When the flight landed at the Dabolim Airport, Rishaan felt uncanny..his excitement seemed replaced by an unknown fear that he found very difficult to decipher. For before she went to the washroom Kiara &nbsp;had carelessly muttered some words in her sleepy state.</p>
				<p>Reaching Goa was delayed by another half an hour as the landing wasn&rsquo;t available . By this time Kiara was wide awake and the drowsy effect of the medicine was wearing off .Diya looked dazed and Rishaan confused.</p>
				<p>Reaching Goa they checked into a hotel followed by a walk on the beach.</p>
				<p>Rishaan was a couple of steps behind them.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Deedi listen to me , want to tell you something ,&rsquo;whispered&nbsp; Diya .</p>
				<p>Yes ? kaira braced herself &nbsp;for the worst news of her life, may be she was getting married to her husband, may be she too wanted to&nbsp; eliminate her from their lives .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;. Rishaan is wanting me to sign on the property that dad left us and I am not happy .&rsquo;She looked behind lest she was heard.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;please understand, we are in danger! &rsquo;, she said hurriedly.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;He even tried to force himself on me .I don&rsquo;t like him didi please don&rsquo;t tell him !.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>Kiara was stunned into silence.Her poor little sister and all this while she stayed angry with her !</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Deedi don&rsquo;t tax yourself .I will sort it out ,&rsquo;murmured Diya tearfully .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;I wished to speak to someone and I thought &hellip;&rsquo;Diya hugged her sister&nbsp; sobbing and jerking her head .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Whats going on with the sisters ?</p>
				<p>Rishaan caught up the pace with hurried steps.</p>
				<p>Kiaras heart was pounding in her chest . She had to control herself</p>
				<p><em>Nikhil &nbsp;where are you? Help me !</em></p>
				<p>&lsquo;Diya what happened ? he asked her mockingly. What have you been telling Kiara &nbsp;?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>She looked at him speechless.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Where are the papers of our estate in Ooty &lsquo;, this time Kiara asked him with a fixed gaze.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;What papers ?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;My dad&rsquo;s estates in Ooty .&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;You frighten me kiara, why do you look at me like this ?Oh you don&rsquo;t trust me ? your sister is an idiot &rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;It is simple .I want my things back that&rsquo;s all&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;How much do you remember &hellip;&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Hand it all back to me or else I may blurt out the truth&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;What truth huh?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;That I was pushed off the balcony with an intent to murder .&rsquo;</p>
				<p>Rishaan looked pale and slouched in the nearest chair .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;You tried to kill me Rishaan and &hellip;&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
				<p>Before she knew he had attacked her and was pulling her hair.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;You bitch,I am not letting go of all this . Killing your parents meant a lot of planning ,hard work and with you too I had plans but &hellip;.&rsquo;</p>
				<p><em>But it&nbsp; was a road accident.</em></p>
				<p>&lsquo;That is what you think &lsquo;</p>
				<p><em>What ?</em></p>
				<p>&lsquo;Yes I manipulated the whole thing .I have never loved you but only your dads vast estates.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>Diya heard the loud cries and tried to stop him .</p>
				<p>Shinde appeared from behind walking stealthily towards Rishaan .</p>
				<p>Rishaan looked deathly.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;What is this ?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Goa was your plan and rest was mine .Kiara informed us when she remembered the details of attempted murder , he continued ,&rsquo; she expressed her apprehensions of going with you on a vacation. She wanted security and we wanted evidence .Didn&rsquo;t know it would be so easy , &lsquo;he &nbsp;chuckled .</p>
				<p>&ldquo;By the way the doctor who was your accomplice has spilled the beans too.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The sisters looked at one another<em>&hellip;</em></p>
				<p>&nbsp;Deedi I am sorry for all this said Diya seeing Rishaan being taken away.</p>
				<p>She looked at her lovely innocent face and a wave of affection surged over her just like a big wave that receded to the far end of the sea with many others lapping into one another and the sun cast a golden hue on water .</p>
				<p>Together they walked back through the sand to the hotel silent yet complete.</p>
				<p>Ended.</p>
