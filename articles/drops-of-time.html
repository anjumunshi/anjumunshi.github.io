				<p>She was amidst the white and grey tombstones in the middle of the graveyard. There was no mourning no funeral but an urge to feel and touch peace. It was a need to sit in calm surroundings rummage through the book of life&nbsp; and what better place than that where no one talked, no one judged, no one cheated .There were no threats, no desires. The horizontally placed bodies in neat enclosures gave a silent support as though saying &lsquo;we know what you are going through, for we have been through all this &lsquo;. She felt reassured in that vast quietitude where a segment lay lifeless, resting in wisdom and experience. She usually went there to get affirmations when in doubt.</p>
				<p>And she did get answers.</p>
				<p>Her apartment oversaw the cemetery and very often she looked out of her window to communicate with that undefined, unknown community. The eerie silence would be comforting.</p>
				<p>She was not alone.</p>
				<p>The souls danced in liberty and peace. . .and so did she.</p>
				<p>Travelling back in time can be therapeutic. It is like a purification process in the fire of self-assessment. She did it often for this was an exercise in acceptance, important in all therapies.</p>
				<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Wake up!&rdquo; &nbsp;...</em></p>
				<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>ma see how I look, I have so many hands so much power;</em></p>
				<p><em>&nbsp;you look so angelic</em> ma<em>, where are you?</em></p>
				<p>&lsquo;Wake up, its late, I am going &lsquo;, sounded like an echo, a voice from afar!</p>
				<p>&nbsp;Maya jumped out of her bed for it wasn&rsquo;t her mother but her domestic help A delay of even a few minutes would make her hysterical for she had a workload of working in three apartments.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Oh yes sorry I overslept.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Your tea is on the table&rsquo;, she yelled before slamming the door.</p>
				<p>Sipping tea and browsing through the newspapers was a daily ritual that provided her with enough time to plan for the day.</p>
				<p>In the shower Maya was trying to put the pieces of her life together.</p>
				<p>Her best friend Sara helped her settle down in her new environment after her marriage to Arun. She found a beautiful two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for them and introduced them to new friends&rsquo; new places etc.</p>
				<p>She was a great person to be with. Beautiful and charming she could energize any place. At the same time she could be melodramatic .Maya doted on her and admired her for being straightforward. Her sense of happiness was infectious and her laughter divine.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;<em>Ma I love sara but ...&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;But what?&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p>&lsquo; she is like a child ma , she is &nbsp;like a spoilt brat who can be intrusive &nbsp;&lsquo;, and with that she narrated a couple of incidents and both mother and daughter burst out laughing .While Aarti was trying to understand her persona Maya , treated Sara like a&nbsp; beautiful mystery.</p>
				<p>Aartis marriage was no magic and even though she had been a good mother, somewhere there was a void in her daughters&rsquo; emotional fabric. She would trust too soon and too much. She was trying to gauge and get as much information as she could as her daughter was settling on foreign shores, far away from a small town that had seen her blossom. Even though she looked happy, Aarti was aware of the vulnerabilities that her daughter had.</p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Arun dotes on me &lsquo;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;See ma my beautiful new ring!&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p>Maya would gush out in appreciation but Arti would just stay quiet.</p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;And what do you cook for Arun?&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p>&lsquo;<em>Oh come on ma. I just google what Arun wants to eat or Sara comes to my rescue at times, gets home cooked food ;don&rsquo;t worry he doesn&rsquo;t get to know !&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p>Sometimes Aarti would see Maya just go blank, as though trying to recall something.</p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;What happened dear?&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p>&lsquo;<em>You know ma my friends think Arun has got a soft spot for her but I know it isn&rsquo;t true.&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p>Aarti could sense a fleeting discomfort but soon added,<em>&rsquo;Maya don&rsquo;t let your husband grow so close to anyone and always trust your instincts &lsquo;.</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;No nothing like that ma !&rsquo;</em>, she laughed .</p>
				<p>How pretty her daughter was , but how <em>na&iuml;ve</em> !She lacked worldly wisdom and Aarti after her divorce had become too protective towards her daughter .She wanted to caution her without scaring , advise her without moralizing and at times used to wonder if she is passing her insecurities and fears to her . So just chose to listen to her and soak it all in.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;So great was her awe for Sara that Maya&nbsp; happily welcomed the 'other women' in her life with an &eacute;lan and an ease which was unfathomable. It foxed her friends. How could she, when most of the women would have clawed their husbands with unforgiving gestures, caustic comments and rabid behaviour. In a marital domain slightest flings can lead to suspicions.</p>
				<p>Maya stayed unaware, for Sara navigated this slippery terrain of adultery, good time, money and sex with great intelligence and secrecy. Her husband Jehangir Khan was a well-connected politician, and everyone wanted to play safe. Sara loved her status and enjoyed arranging drop-of-a-hat parties, films and other activities that promised great fun. Probably she lacked security and a feeling of wantedness and loved to be fussed over. Strangely enough synthetic alliances fall pale when pitted against ones that have a purity of purpose, for the latter have an energy that draws people instantly towards oneself. Maya was different as she appeared comfortable in this arrangement.</p>
				<p>Suraiyya the neighborhood masseur would narrate Saras rendezvous&nbsp; to her women clients as her hands would do their work. ... .</p>
				<p><em>Maya , don&rsquo;t mind but the grapevine says&hellip;.. </em></p>
				<p><em>Are you crazy ? Grow up girls , what a shallow mindset !My arun&nbsp; is very honest and I trust him.&nbsp; </em></p>
				<p>The water was too hot and almost scalded her cheek.</p>
				<p><em>Aruuuun my face is burning . </em></p>
				<p><em>Don&rsquo;t scream ,what happened ?</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Your face is burnt , acid&rsquo; said the doctor </em></p>
				<p><em>Whhhat ?</em></p>
				<p><em>Ma I think someone put acid in my moisturizer bottle my face is burnt on one side .!!</em></p>
				<p><em>Maya come back </em></p>
				<p><em>Ma &hellip;Arun said the sweeper may have accidentally &hellip;.</em></p>
				<p><em>Who &hellip;? What the hell is going on ?come back Maya!</em></p>
				<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
				<p><em>Maya I need to go to Bangkok for a conference </em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;Oh I too could go then &lsquo;&lsquo; </em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo; I will be back in two days time &lsquo;you can recover in the meantime &lsquo;.Look pretty when I am back.</em></p>
				<p><em>Ummmn ok that is fine but you have to call me twice a day .</em></p>
				<p><em>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</em></p>
				<p><em>His phone is switched off ma</em></p>
				<p><em>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</em></p>
				<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
				<p><em>Maam he is out with &hellip;</em></p>
				<p><em>&nbsp;colleagues .. I know but is he &nbsp;ok ?</em></p>
				<p><em>Oh thank you .</em></p>
				<p><em>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</em></p>
				<p>Surely he can call me. At least to check up on my face. She tried his phone again and this time it rang .</p>
				<p>Hello!! Hello!!Who is this please and the phone got disconnected after a brief hello. She willed herself to not check her phone to see if he had replied. It had been about three days now. She hated that she was constantly checking his 'last seen at' status and yes, he had logged in just five minutes ago. Yet she couldn't stop herself. This sinking feeling to find absolutely no communication from him was becoming unbearable, almost torturous.<br /> <br /> And then, just as she sat down in her chair, her phone vibrated. With her heart thudding in her ear, she unlocked her phone and stared at the screen. Finally! It was his message.<br /> <br /> But when she opened it and read it, she nearly stopped breathing. She didn't know if he was joking or not.</p>
				<p>He was with Sara?</p>
				<p>There was a picture too.</p>
				<p>Mad is he?</p>
				<p>How can he? she thought.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;<em>Maya come back &lsquo;, mother admonished her in an unmoving tone as though she knew.</em></p>
				<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
				<p><em>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</em></p>
				<p>She finished the bath and came out with a pounding headache. The water was truly hot. Rolled in a towel she stepped out carefully.</p>
				<p>She sat down after brushing her wet hair and touched the scar on her face. It had healed and many told her that it added to her charm, especially when she smiled.</p>
				<p><em>Wisdom lines, wisdom scars.</em></p>
				<p>Going back in time helped one in handling one&rsquo;s anguish and pain. Like any other revisions in schools, it only made one better and stronger at a subject.</p>
				<p>She remembered a passage from a book that she was reading.</p>
				<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
				<p><em>&lsquo;There is a sense of calm and peace as karma postures itself. Karma is not only dishing out good for good and evil for evil; it also stands for accepting the choices one makes in life. Karma means attaining a poise in life , when one sits back and reflects on ones perceptions and attitudes, accepts them&nbsp; and owns up all that follows.&rsquo;</em></p>
				<p>Arun had called her up on several occasions expressing his desire to get back as Sara was not only overbearing but had involved him in a fraud. The channels were talking about how the two were involved in a&nbsp; major &lsquo;embezzlement&rsquo; and a big case was being made against them. Jehangir Khan had disowned his wife as he didn&rsquo;t want the scandal to scathe his reputation .She kept seeing Aruns face on the TV from time to time and it surprised her that she was watching it with a calm curiosity .Reporters would call up frequently for an interview from the ex-wife which she would decline even before they&rsquo;d ask her.</p>
				<p>If love is blinding, betrayal is strengthening. It is ironical that pain and bitterness furnish one&rsquo;s inner core with a resilience that is hard to beat.</p>
				<p>There comes in a calm, a resolve that is defining and definite. Probably love is an overrated emotion a debilitating phenomenon, a superfluous emotion glorified over the years by poets and writers, a hormonal flux dotted with lust, &nbsp;greed and selfishness .It is expensive too ,as it costs peace and dignity. It was his turn now. It was his chosen course; a price to pay for love, his karma. Life had plans for him.</p>
				<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
				<p>The shadows lengthened, the place turned darker, the somber sky with the fading lights gave the cemetery a cold, forsaken look. An occasional stir in the nearby bushes alerted her .She waited .She had conquered love and defeated her failings. She had reinvented herself. She was in line with life Maya heard it again.&nbsp; Turning around she clearly saw her mother&rsquo;s shadow. this time she looked more complete and resolute as though congratulating her for her renewed energy, a confidence that Maya was empowered to live her life with meaning and substance. She was the deity with many arms, much power. She could feel the drops of time, enriching the graves. She smiled at the shadow, was tempted to hug it but instead turned back and hurried her pace.</p>
