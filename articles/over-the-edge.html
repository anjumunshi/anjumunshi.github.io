				<div class="subtitle" style="font-size: 45px;">Rage of Love</div>
				<p>There was an eerie silence. My father&rsquo;s breathing appeared loud and embarrassing.</p>
				<p>He was trembling in rage , &ldquo;Our mistakes stem out&nbsp;of&nbsp;an anxiety to see our children do well,and &nbsp;you all act from a youthful frenzied mind that fails to engage in responsible actions .want to get married to her ? her?&hellip;a Christian girl?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; and he faced me with a scornful look that warranted much bitterness and hatred .</p>
				<p>Sensing the growing tension ,my mother led him out of the room.</p>
				<p>I needed an approving glance that could lift my &nbsp;sagging spirits. I liked Sara and so did she but wanted to carry my family along with in this celebration of love and my new life .Sara and I had decided to get married despite her being from a different faith but as a good son I wanted to not rebel but rejoice with my parents with their blessings . Unfortunately this was not going anywhere .I fail to understand , despite unconditional love by the parents, as they claim , why this rigidity ? This is not about what anyone else likes, it's about liking something that is special to their own child.</p>
				<p>It has never been &nbsp;easy to understand my father who has been living with this doggedness of pure Hindu religion .He is full of compassion and tolerance but &nbsp;when it comes to his religion he is beyond reason .<em>Hinduism is the most cherished line of ones belief and an attempt to merge or go away from it spells disaster</em>, is his favourite line &nbsp;. Due to his constant fault finding sessions with other religions. &lsquo;<em>we are Hindus&rsquo; and also &lsquo;upon my dead body</em> &hellip;.i was beginning to revolt against him and his beliefs .On one side he said he could do anything for my happiness and on the other side heavens came falling down &nbsp;every time I mentioned Sara . Unknowingly my father had been strengthening my resolve, that of spending my life with the love of my life.</p>
				<p>Sara was amazing. There was grace compassion and an unfathomable understanding of human emotions in her .My college mates called me lucky . Some even sounded envious . Many tried their luck with her but couldn&rsquo;t reach anywhere. Even my best friend Chirag told me once &lsquo; buddy anytime you change your mind , I am there &lsquo;</p>
				<p>How dare you say this ? Do you have any decency , Chirag?&rsquo;,Sara would retort angrily.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Ok ok don&rsquo;t get so angry,all yours&rsquo; , he would get into squeals of laughter .</p>
				<p>I felt fortunate.</p>
				<p>Such incidents would take place in the college very often; for Sara was like that , charming attractive and above all considerate .</p>
				<p>One fine morning a note from Sara startled me . She had called off the relationship. Her father had taken ill all of a sudden and she being the only child had to look after her family and other social obligations This is what she explained to me &nbsp;.It sounded hollow like a lame justification. I could have helped her deal with it .</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>It shook me up.</p>
				<p>I had been let down.</p>
				<p>What would I tell my father for he would feel victorious , feeling that he had driven sense into me .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Hello Sara what joke is this ? , I could feel my voice break.</p>
				<p>Silence</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Sorry Vikram, I .... cannot go ahead.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>I could sense a lot of pain in her voice . A pain of letting a relationship go may be ?</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Sara but why ? I know you don&rsquo;t mean it . Are you trying me out ? what nonsense is this ? .&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;I am serious Vikram, it is over &lsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t sound alright . what is it ? please don&rsquo;t do this to me &lsquo;. I was aware of my helplessness ,as conveyed to me by my faltering tone .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;What is it pl tell me?&rsquo;Is it my father , did he say something ?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>hello hello !!</p>
				<p>Silence</p>
				<p>And the phone went off .</p>
				<p>Something died within me . If I had to pen down my inner feelings, I don&rsquo;t think I could do justice , for there were many explosions within me . . I felt cold in the thought&nbsp;of&nbsp;my own awkwardness, ashamed of my being .I was being laid bare on something and felt as limp and plain as paper. I felt lifeless.</p>
				<p>I was sure my father had played a communal incompatibility card and I was too exhausted emotionally to even reason it out with him , especially after sensing the seriousness in her voice .</p>
				<p>She was not for it anymore .</p>
				<p>Sure enough , after a couple of months ,my noble father arranged a match for me and my mother got busy with the wedding festivities .My mind was wandering . The yearnings&nbsp;of&nbsp;love were alive and I was training my mind and heart not to travel in forbidden areas of gloom and sorrow ...I was trying to &nbsp;push myself &nbsp;out from this zone and slowly establish new ways&nbsp;of&nbsp;relating to others. I was right at the edge&nbsp;of&nbsp;a big shift, and could not &nbsp;make things change any faster than reality would &nbsp;allow. It was as if my&nbsp; speed limit was being set by external events, rather than by my own intent. Frustration stemmed out&nbsp;of&nbsp;sheer helplessness ..My new life had a wife who I didn t know at all, some bunch of new relatives who I had no interest in and lots of conversations that had no meaning for me . I just wanted to cut myself from commitments and be loose from obligations for just a while. It pays to distance yourself from people you love for then the myopic range is removed and you are in true light&nbsp;of&nbsp;everything.</p>
				<p>I missed Sara.</p>
				<p>Pamela, my wordly wife &nbsp;was more talkative than usual, but&nbsp;beneath the clever stories and engaging chatter &nbsp;was an intelligent woman who believed strongly in being good..With me she had run into a stone wall but only for a while for I gave in to her very strong and cheery &nbsp;presence that actually healed me over the years. Amihas birth was a reward to all my&nbsp; sufferings ,I would tell myself. Bringing up my daughter with Pamela was a delight indeed . My feelings had run their full course . From the cosmic recycling bin, I had emerged stronger and zestful and I did come back alive from life&rsquo;s compost pile in the words of my grandmother who would often say &nbsp;&lsquo;today's garbage magically transforms into tomorrow's healthy soil&rsquo;. &lsquo;Be patient and allow the process to evolve at its own pace'. Sara was like a pale shadow of yesterday and Pamela was my strong present. It looked to be true now after so many years. Nature's way&nbsp;of&nbsp;rejuvenating recreating and nurturing I guess.</p>
				<p>One day a call from my friend &nbsp;Naresh surprised me . He tracked me down from my face book account .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Hi how have you been?&rsquo;, I asked gleefully for the joy of discovering ones friends after years is beyond words .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;You know we are finally getting married .&rsquo;he chuckled in great joy .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;When is that ?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Fourth of February &lsquo;</p>
				<p>Naresh and Sahana were going together for some time , it took a while for the parents to concede to the alliance . The note of happiness and triumph was unmistakable and something tugged at my heart .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Oh yes yes &nbsp;would love to .&rsquo;</p>
				<p>He insisted that I come with my family which I happily agreed to. The day arrived for us to go for the wedding to Bangalaru.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;It was still dawn when I stepped out of the cab and walked towards the entry gate of the Delhi airport. The early morning February air was pleasantly cold.<br /> <br /> I was travelling to Bengaluru to attend a college friend's wedding. It had been four years since we graduated from the same college. This wedding was also going to be a reunion of our batchmates. But what I didn't know was that the reunion would begin much ahead of time; right in the queue in front of the airline counter.I was almost sure it was she. Same height! Same long hair! Same complexion! Curiosity had my eyes glued to her. And then about 60-odd seconds later, when she turned, she proved me right. My ex-girlfriend stood two places ahead of me in that queue. We had never met after the college farewell.</p>
				<p><br /> A scarf hid half her face rather awkwardly , I doubt if she saw me and without knowing I followed her .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Excuse me pl.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>She walked even faster</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Hello Sara this is me , Vikram.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>She &nbsp;hurried her steps .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Sara stop , this is me from college, it has been so many yearsss &hellip;..&rsquo;</p>
				<p>She turned back with a scarf that covered her face only the forehead was bare ,and then flung it away for me to see her .</p>
				<p>I froze in an undefined and complex web of emotions for what I saw was a hideous black and red blotchy face with one eye staring out of it .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Yes you are right ,so many years it has been for me to be like this .&rsquo;</p>
				<p>I couldn&rsquo;t ask for I was speechless in horror .</p>
				<p>I had an urge to touch her face however despicable it appeared.</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Chirag your best friend didn&rsquo;t like us being together and wanted me to marry him under threat and when I refused he did this to me &lsquo;, she continued .</p>
				<p>My legs were giving way and I sank in one of the benches that give temporary relief to a wandering traveler .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;You took no action ?&rsquo; I was screaming with an unfamiliar &nbsp;tremor in my voice. It couldn&rsquo;t be my voice .</p>
				<p>Her beautiful face was scarred for ever .Oh my dear Sara</p>
				<p>&lsquo;That is why I &hellip;&rsquo;,she cut it short .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;I spoke to your father ,seeking his forgiveness and also about my decision to end our relationship.&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Your father is a very good man. He spoke to me and also suggested that it would shatter you for you loved me dearly .He even suggested plastic surgery &hellip; he loves you dearly and was worried for you . For me I feel blessed to have had you as a friend who loved me .&rsquo; She stopped for she was &nbsp;getting breathless I guess.</p>
				<p>The picture was clear to me . My father was aware of the acid attack on Sara &nbsp;and he didn&rsquo;t tell me for my well being ?</p>
				<p>He sure would have been happy at all this , but Sara who could see goodness in people ,certified his being human after all .</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>My friend Chirag, stooped so low ,for spurning the advances he made towards my Sara? A coward , a slime, a criminal ? Thousands of questions were obstructing my rational thinking .</p>
				<p>Faintly I could see Pamela from a distance holding on to her coffee and Amiha, also looking at me with concern for I was trying to steady myself holding on to a counter .But she didn&rsquo;t make any attempt to intrude in this conversation as she was instinctive .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t get angry with your father . Any father would do this and aren&rsquo;t you happy ?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;I have been checking on you and am aware of your beautiful family .&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me ?&rsquo; , I heard myself say .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;There was no point for I didn&rsquo;t want to spoil it all for you .I had to have reconstructive surgeries for me to breathe properly .The acid hit my nose and my right eye .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Are you going for the wedding ?&rsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;No not in this state&rsquo;, she smiled wryly .I felt insane for asking her this .She pulled the scarf back on her face .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;I am going to see my mother who stays in Bangalore . My father couldn&rsquo;t bear this and passed away four years ago .&rsquo;</p>
				<p>She had wrapped &nbsp;and concealed the ugly dark tidings within her bosom and even today she marched ahead with an unbelievable composure, a calm that could disarm many .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;So what are you doing now ?&rsquo; I wiped the sweat off my brow as I regained my composure .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;I am modeling &lsquo;</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Whattt ? &lsquo;I was aghast</p>
				<p>&lsquo;Yes I work with &lsquo;Face of courage &lsquo;.I walk the ramp with confidence and a belief in myself ,stride down the catwalk ,and smile &nbsp;at the cameras with my scarred face in focus .&rsquo;</p>
				<p>I felt faint and sick and looked for some support to hold on to .</p>
				<p>&lsquo;I get paid for this and stay in a one room apartment .I will be going for another reconstructive surgery funded by them and am looking forward to it. &lsquo;</p>
				<p>For a moment I felt guilty and ashamed for having a comfortable lifestyle.</p>
				<p>Pamela who I was oblivious to ,had walked closer and was standing next to us listening to the entire conversation but behaved all along like a stranger playfully keeping Amiha engaged&nbsp; . She was aware of the Sara chapter of my life .After saying a faint goodbye to Sara , my eyes followed her till she was out of sight . Soon after ,Pamela held my hand in complete empathy and that worked like magic.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Back home I checked the organization . It is aimed at raising awareness of those who have lost their physical beauty to acid attacks and to make them self reliant and with support groups.</p>
				<p>We went for the wedding and my sorrow got drowned in my wife&rsquo;s cheerful disposition and the noisy rituals. A month later as I was going through the newspaper my wife immediately pulled me from the bed to watch something on the television which was in the living room .</p>
				<p>It was Sara with the botched up face being felicitated and was receiving an award from none other than the &nbsp;first lady of Unites States of America ,Michelle Obama who was on a trip to india .In this all elusive <em>fountain of youth</em> concept, the beauty of the mind gets unnoticed, I thought to myself .Sara made no effort to hide her face for her soul was shining pure and bright .Pamela looked radiant and happy and really beautiful from within. I could see that clearly.</p>
				<p>The cycle of the cosmos was complete.</p>
